    <h2>The Story of Lili:</h2>
    <h3>A History of the Magnanimous Corgi</h3>
    <p>Lili was born in rural Oregon in a haven full of dozens of Corgis. When
      she was 8 weeks old she left her home to go live with a new family.
      <br>
      This family loves her dearly despite her phobia of large circles and other
      dogs. She enjoys activities such as watching TV,
      <br>
      stealing your food, and riding the family cat. She is a mere five months
      old so much of her story has yet to be told.
